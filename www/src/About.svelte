<h3>Where do I get GÃ¶rli Ether?</h3>
<p>
  Get it from a faucet (<a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/">1</a>,
  <a href="https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/">2</a>,
  <a href="https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/">3</a>,
  <a href="https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/">4</a>). If you are lazy you can also
  come to our
  <a href="https://discord.gg/RgJdhMx8PR">discord server</a> and ask for some GÃ¶erli
  Ether in the "ðŸ’¸ I need Goerli Eth" channel. Remember to share your wallet address.
</p>

<h3>What are keys and where do I get them?</h3>
<p>
  Keys are 24-word mnemonic phrases hidden in the game. If you find a key, you
  can claim it in the "keys" section of the game. Insert the mnemonic in the
  input box and submit it. If it's correct it will appear in the leaderboard
  next to your address.

<h3>I'm stuck, can I get a hint?</h3>
<p>
  Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/cxZxcu7MN7">discord server</a>, we have a
  channel where you can ask for help called "ðŸ†˜ I need help".

<h3>Why should I register an ENS name?</h3>
<p>
  Addresses are cool but they are very difficult to pronounce and remember.
  Worry not, if you register an ENS name <strong>on GÃ¶rli</strong> you can
  customize your name and avatar in the leadeboard! How cool is that!
  <small>
    (The real reason to do it is because we spent quite some time to integrate
    ENS in this app so please show some appreciation to our overly stressed devs
    and create an ENS entry and add an avatar image as well <strike>
      but please don't use the <code>ipfs://</code> schema or fancy NFT profile pics
      it would be cool ofc we are all here for decentralization but we didn't have
      enough time to integrate this PRs WELCOME!
    </strike> and you can use `ipfs://` and `bzz://`!)

<h3>How do I register my ENS name?</h3>
<p>
  Export your mnemonic to another wallet, go to the ENS domain and register your
  name in the <strong>GÃ¶rli network</strong>. You can also add an avatar (we
  only support `http` and `https` schemes).
