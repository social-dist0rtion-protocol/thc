<h3>What are keys and where do I get them?</h3>
<p>
  Keys are secrets hidden in the game. If you find a key, you can claim it in
  the "keys" section of the game. Insert the key in the input box and submit it.
  If it's correct a fancy 🔑 will appear in the leaderboard next to your
  address.

<h3>Why should I register an ENS name?</h3>
<p>
  Addresses are cool but they are very difficult to pronounce and remember.
  Worry not, if you register an ENS name <strong>on Sepolia</strong> you can
  customize your name and avatar in the leadeboard! How cool is that!
  <small>
    (The real reason to do it is because we spent quite some time to integrate
    ENS in this app so please show some appreciation to our overly stressed devs
    and create an ENS entry and add an avatar image as well <strike>
      but please don't use the <code>ipfs://</code> schema or fancy NFT profile pics
      it would be cool ofc we are all here for decentralization but we didn't have
      enough time to integrate this PRs WELCOME!
    </strike> and you can use `ipfs://` and `bzz://`!)

</p>

<h3>How do I register my ENS name?</h3>
<p>
  Export your mnemonic to another wallet, go to the ENS domain and register your
  name in the <strong>Sepolia network</strong>. You can also add an avatar (we
  only support `http` and `https` schemes).
