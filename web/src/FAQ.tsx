            channel, or visit us at, we are in the third floor (check the map!).

        <Text>
          The side quests are optional puzzles. All documents start with the
          hashtag symbol #. They may require specific technical skills. Don't
          expect them to be easy. Actually, we really hope all of them will be
          solved at one point, we put so much sweat ðŸ˜“ on them (figuratively).
          You don't need to do them, but you earn extra points if you complete
          them.
